# Password Validation Web JS

This Password Validation web form created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a user interface that allows users to enter a password and checks whether the password meets certain criteria before submitting it. The form typically includes input fields for the password and a confirmation of the password.

The HTML code for the form includes the input fields and a submit button. The CSS code is used to style the form and make it visually appealing. JavaScript code is used to validate the password and give feedback to the user if the password does not meet the specified criteria.

The password validation typically checks for the following criteria:

Length of password (minimum and maximum characters)
Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
Presence of numbers and special characters

When the user submits the form, the JavaScript code checks the password against these criteria and gives feedback to the user if the password does not meet the requirements
